    <h2>Bio</h2>

    <p>
        Member list of Maroon 5, an American pop rock band from Los Angeles, California. The group originally formed in 1994 as Kara's Flowers with a line-up of Adam Levine, Jesse Carmichael, Mickey Madden and Ryan Dusick.
        In 2001, guitarist James Valentine joined and the band changed the name to Maroon 5.[1]
        In 2006, Dusick departed the band and was replaced by Matt Flynn, originally a touring member from 2004 to 2006.
        In 2010, PJ Morton auditioned to be a touring keyboardist and backing vocalist of Maroon 5 and joined the band. Morton became an official member when he filled-in for Jesse Carmichael (who took a temporary break from performing with the group to focus on his studies) from 2012 to 2014 and as Carmichael returned to the band in 2014. In 2016, multi-instrumentalist Sam Farrar, who had been touring with the band since 2012, was announced as an official member. Since then, Maroon 5 is formally a seven-piece band.
